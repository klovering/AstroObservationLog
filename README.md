# AstroObservationLog

Quick iOS side test project to allow users to log using the American Association of Amateur Astronomers format

## Idea: Astronomy log iOS app.

There are a few programs that do this already built in with other astronomy fuctions, but there isn’t a simple app that only focuses on this that I've found in my quick search. As an amateur astronomer you get to aim for pins and certificates after you observe a certain amount of objects. This could serve as a nice simple app to record what you've seen.

Initially I’d just like to create a native iOS app, in Swift, that allows you to enter and save observations in the same format as The American Association of Amateur Astronomers (http://www.astromax.org/pdf/a4-obsfm.pdf). I’d also like to add the ability to print out or email a PDF of all logs.

Long term I have other goals, but I’m keeping them out of focus for now.

I’ve never written an iOS app and don’t know Swift. It’ll be an adventure!
